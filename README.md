# Movie-Preference-Database

## Description
   Our project is to develop a web application similar to IMDB, which will provide users with a comprehensive database of movies and TV shows. The application will be built using modern web development frameworks and technologies such as react.js, and it will have a user-friendly interface that allows users to search, filter, and browse content easily.

The database will include information about movies, including titles, release dates, ratings and watchlist. Users can also create accounts, rate movies, write reviews, and save their favorite content to watchlists.

To differentiate our web application from IMDB, we aim to provide a more clear and intuitive user interface, content recommendations based on current viewing movie, an ad-free experience, and better search filters. 

Throughout the development process, we use best practices in software engineering, including version control, testing, and code review. We also prioritize user feedback and continuously iterate on the application to improve its features and functionality.

By the end of the project, We have created a fully functional web application that provides a user-friendly and personalized experience for movie enthusiasts.
